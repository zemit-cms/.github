# Zemit Documentation Style Guide

This style guide is intended to maintain consistency, clarity, and quality in the documentation of the Zemit project.

## General Guidelines

- **Clarity and Brevity**: Write in clear, concise language. Avoid unnecessary jargon and complex language.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout the documentation.
- **User-Centric**: Write with the reader in mind. Anticipate their needs and questions.

## Formatting Standards

### Headers

- Use headers to organize content hierarchically.
- Start with `#` for top-level headers, and use subsequent levels (`##`, `###`, etc.) for subheaders.

### Code Blocks

- Use triple backticks (\```) for code blocks.
- Specify the language for syntax highlighting where applicable.

### Lists

- Use bulleted lists for unordered items.
- Use numbered lists for ordered steps or procedures.

### Links

- Use descriptive text for hyperlinks rather than "click here" or "link".
- Ensure all links are relevant and up-to-date.

## Writing Style

- **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice to passive voice.
- **Second Person**: Address the reader directly as "you".
- **Present Tense**: Use present tense where possible.

## Technical Content

- Clearly explain technical concepts and include examples where relevant.
- Use inline code formatting (`) for function names, variables, and file paths.

## Visual Content

- Use screenshots or diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
- Ensure all images are high quality and have descriptive alt text.

## Review Process

- All documentation changes should be reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and adherence to this style guide.

## Updates

- Regularly review and update the documentation to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

Remember, the goal of this style guide is to make Zemit's documentation a reliable and valuable resource for all users.
Contributions that adhere to these guidelines are greatly appreciated.
