### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. If
you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear
description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the
expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the

Provide as much detail and context as possible.
